Datsets used in project
Training Dataset: eleven datasets of different tissues from three species

This datasets including the modification sites in the different tissues of human (brain, kidney and liver), mouse (brain, heart, kidney, liver and testis), and rat (brain, kidney, liver). All the RNA fragment samples are 41-nt long with Adenine in the center site. Using the CD-HIT program to reduce sequence homology bias and remove sequences with sequence similarity more than 80%.
